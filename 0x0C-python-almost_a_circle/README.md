## Almost a circle

This project reviews everything I have learned so far in Python in the ALX Software engineering programming, including:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
  - JSON
  - Serialization/Deserialization

A new concept I'll learn is:

- ```args``` and ```kwargs```
